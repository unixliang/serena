# latest
Status of the `main` branch. Changes prior to the next official version change will appear here.

* Language support:
  * **Add support for R** via the R languageserver package with LSP integration, performance optimizations, and fallback symbol extraction
  * **Add support for Zig** via ZLS (cross-file references may not fully work on Windows)
  * **Add support for Lua** via lua-language-server
  * **Add support for Nix** requires nixd installation (Windows not supported)
  * **Dart now officially supported**: Dart was always working, but now tests were added, and it is promoted to "officially supported"
  * **Rust now uses already installed rustup**: The rust-analyzer is no longer bundled with Serena. Instead, it uses the rust-analyzer from your Rust toolchain managed by rustup. This ensures compatibility with your Rust version and eliminates outdated bundled binaries.
  * **Kotlin now officially supported**: We now use the official Kotlin LS, tests run through and performance is good, even though the LS is in an early development stage. 
  * **Add support for Erlang** experimental, may hang or be slow, uses the recently archived [erlang_ls](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls)
  * **Ruby dual language server support**: Added ruby-lsp as the modern primary Ruby language server. Solargraph remains available as an experimental legacy option. ruby-lsp supports both .rb and .erb files, while Solargraph supports .rb files only.

* Client support:
  * New mode `oaicompat-agent` and extensions in the openai tool compatibility, **permitting Serena to work with llama.cpp**

* General:
  * Various fixes related to indexing, special paths and determation of ignored paths
  * Decreased `TOOL_DEFAULT_MAX_ANSWER_LENGTH` to be in accordance with (below) typical max-tokens configurations

# 0.1.4

## Summary

This likely is the last release before the stable version 1.0.0 which will come together with the jetbrains IDE extension.
We release it for users who install Serena from a tag, since the last tag cannot be installed due to a breaking change in the mcp dependency (see #381).

Since the last release, several new languages were supported, and the Serena CLI and configurability were significantly extended.
We thank all external contributors who made a lot of the improvements possible!

* General:
  * **Initial instructions no longer need to be loaded by the user**
  * Significantly extended CLI
  * Removed `replace_regex` tool from `ide-assistant` and `codex` contexts.
    The current string replacement tool in Claude Code seems to be sufficiently efficient and is better
    integrated with the IDE. Users who want to enable `replace_regex` can do so by customizing the context.

* Configuration:
  * Simplify customization of modes and contexts, including CLI support.
  * Possibility to customize the system prompt and outputs of simple tools, including CLI support.
  * Possibility to override tool descriptions through the context YAML.
  * Prompt templates are now automatically adapted to the enabled tools.
  * Several tools are now excluded by default, need to be included explicitly.
  * New context for ChatGPT

* Language servers:
  * Reliably detect language server termination and propagate the respective error all the way
    back to the tool application, where an unexpected termination is handled by restarting the language server
    and subsequently retrying the tool application.
  * **Add support for Swift**
  * **Add support for Bash**
  * Enhance Solargraph (Ruby) integration
    * Automatic Rails project detection via config/application.rb, Rakefile, and Gemfile analysis
    * Ruby/Rails-specific exclude patterns for improved indexing performance (vendor/, .bundle/, tmp/, log/, coverage/)
    * Enhanced error handling with detailed diagnostics and Ruby manager-specific installation instructions (rbenv, RVM, asdf)
    * Improved LSP capability negotiation and analysis completion detection
    * Better Bundler and Solargraph installation error messages with clear resolution steps

Fixes:
* Ignore `.git` in check for ignored paths and improve performance of `find_all_non_ignored_files`
* Fix language server startup issues on Windows when using Claude Code (which was due to
  default shell reconfiguration imposed by Claude Code)
* Additional wait for initialization in C# language server before requesting references, allowing cross-file references to be found.

# 0.1.3

## Summary

This is the first release of Serena to pypi. Since the last release, we have greatly improved 
stability and performance, as well as extended functionality, improved editing tools and included support for several new languages. 

* **Reduce the use of asyncio to a minimum**, improving stability and reducing the need for workarounds
   * Switch to newly developed fully synchronous LSP library `solidlsp` (derived from `multilspy`),
     removing our fork of `multilspy` (src/multilspy)
   * Switch from fastapi (which uses asyncio) to Flask in the Serena dashboard
   * The MCP server is the only asyncio-based component now, which resolves cross-component loop contamination,
     such that process isolation is no longer required.
     Neither are non-graceful shutdowns on Windows.
* **Improved editing tools**: The editing logic was simplified and improved, making it more robust.
   * The "minimal indentation" logic was removed, because LLMs did not understand it.
   * The logic for the insertion of empty lines was improved (mostly controlled by the LLM now)
* Add a task queue for the agent, which is executed in a separate and thread and
   * allows the language server to be initialized in the background, making the MCP server respond to requests
     immediately upon startup,
   * ensures that all tool executions are fully synchronized (executed linearly).
* `SearchForPatternTool`: Better default, extended parameters and description for restricting the search
* Language support:
   * Better support for C# by switching from `omnisharp` to Microsoft's official C# language server.
   * **Add support for Clojure, Elixir and Terraform. New language servers for C# and typescript.**
   * Experimental language server implementations can now be accessed by users through configuring the `language` field
* Configuration:
   * Add option `web_dashboard_open_on_launch` (allowing the dashboard to be enabled without opening a browser window) 
   * Add options `record_tool_usage_stats` and `token_count_estimator`
   * Serena config, modes and contexts can now be adjusted from the user's home directory.
   * Extended CLI to help with configuration
* Dashboard:
  * Displaying tool usage statistics if enabled in the config

Fixes:
* Fix `ExecuteShellCommandTool` and `GetCurrentConfigTool` hanging on Windows
* Fix project activation by name via `--project` not working (was broken in previous release) 
* Improve handling of indentation and newlines in symbolic editing tools
* Fix `InsertAfterSymbolTool` failing for insertions at the end of a file that did not end with a newline
* Fix `InsertBeforeSymbolTool` inserting in the wrong place in the absence of empty lines above the reference symbol
* Fix `ReplaceSymbolBodyTool` changing whitespace before/after the symbol
* Fix repository indexing not following links and catch exceptions during indexing, allowing indexing
  to continue even if unexpected errors occur for individual files.
* Fix `ImportError` in Ruby language server.
* Fix some issues with gitignore matching and interpreting of regexes in `search_for_pattern` tool.

# 2025-06-20

* **Overhaul and major improvement of editing tools!**
  This represents a very important change in Serena. Symbols can now be addressed by their `name_path` (including nested ones)
  and we introduced a regex-based replaced tools. We tuned the prompts and tested the new editing mechanism.
  It is much more reliable, flexible, and at the same time uses fewer tokens.
  The line-replacement tools are disabled by default and deprecated, we will likely remove them soon.
* **Better multi-project support and zero-config setup**: We significantly simplified the config setup, you no longer need to manually
  create `project.yaml` for each project. Project activation is now always available. 
  Any project can now be activated by just asking the LLM to do so and passing the path to a repo.
* Dashboard as web app and possibility to shut down Serena from it (or the old log GUI).
* Possibility to index your project beforehand, accelerating Serena's tools.
* Initial prompt for project supported (has to be added manually for the moment)
* Massive performance improvement of pattern search tool
* Use **process isolation** to fix stability issues and deadlocks (see #170). 
  This uses separate process for the MCP server, the Serena agent and the dashboard in order to fix asyncio-related issues.

# 2025-05-24

* Important new feature: **configurability of mode and context**, allowing better integration in a variety of clients.
  See corresponding section in readme - Serena can now be integrated in IDE assistants in a more productive way. 
  You can now also do things like switching to one-shot planning mode, ask to plan something (which will create a memory),
  then switch to interactive editing mode in the next conversation and work through the plan read from the memory.
* Some improvements to prompts.

# 2025-05-21

**Significant improvement in symbol finding!**

* Serena core:
    * `FindSymbolTool` now can look for symbols by specifying paths to them, not just the symbol name
* Language Servers:
    * Fixed `gopls` initialization
    * Symbols retrieved through the symbol tree or through overview methods now are linked to their parents


# 2025-05-19

* Serena core:
    * Bugfix in `FindSymbolTool` (a bug fixed in LS)
    * Fix in `ListDirTool`: Do not ignore files with extensions not understood by the language server, only skip ignored directories
      (error introduced in previous version)
    * Merged the two overview tools (for directories and files) into a single one: `GetSymbolsOverviewTool`
    * One-click setup for Cline enabled
    * `SearchForPatternTool` can now (optionally) search in the entire project
    * New tool `RestartLanguageServerTool` for restarting the language server (in case of other sources of editing apart from Serena)
    * Fix `CheckOnboardingPerformedTool`:
        * Tool description was incompatible with project change
        * Returned result was not as useful as it could be (now added list of memories)

* Language Servers:
    * Add further file extensions considered by the language servers for Python (.pyi), JavaScript (.jsx) and TypeScript (.tsx, .jsx)
    * Updated multilspy, adding support for Kotlin, Dart and C/C++ and several improvements.
    * Added support for PHP
    

# 2025-04-07

> **Breaking Config Changes**: make sure to set `ignore_all_files_in_gitignore`, remove `ignore_dirs`
>  and (optionally) set `ignore_paths` in your project configs. See [updated config template](myproject.template.yml)

* Serena core:
    * New tool: FindReferencingCodeSnippets
    * Adjusted prompt in CreateTextFileTool to prevent writing partial content (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jpavtm/comment/mloek1x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).
    * FindSymbolTool: allow passing a file for restricting search, not just a directory (Gemini was too dumb to pass directories)
    * Native support for gitignore files for configuring files to be ignored by serena. See also
      in *Language Servers* section below.
    * **Major Feature**: Allow Serena to switch between projects (project activation)
        * Add central Serena configuration in `serena_config.yml`, which 
            * contains the list of available projects
            * allows to configure whether project activation is enabled
            * now contains the GUI logging configuration (project configurations no longer do)
        * Add new tools `activate_project` and `get_active_project`
        * Providing a project configuration file in the launch parameters is now optional
* Logging:
    * Improve error reporting in case of initialization failure: 
      open a new GUI log window showing the error or ensure that the existing log window remains visible for some time
* Language Servers:
    * Fix C# language server initialization issue when the project path contains spaces
    * Native support for gitignore in overview, document-tree and find_references operations.
      This is an **important** addition, since previously things like `venv` and `node_modules` were scanned
      and were likely responsible for slowness of tools and even server crashes (presumably due to OOM errors).
* Agno: 
    * Fix Agno reloading mechanism causing failures when initializing the sqlite memory database #8
    * Fix Serena GUI log window not capturing logs after initialization
