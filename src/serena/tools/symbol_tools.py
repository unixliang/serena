        Retrieves information on all symbols/code entities (classes, methods, etc.) based on the given `name_path`,
        which represents a pattern for the symbol's path within the symbol tree of a single file.
        The returned symbol location can be used for edits or further queries.
        Specify `depth > 0` to retrieve children (e.g., methods of a class).

        The matching behavior is determined by the structure of `name_path`, which can
        either be a simple name (e.g. "method") or a name path like "class/method" (relative name path)
        or "/class/method" (absolute name path). Note that the name path is not a path in the file system
        but rather a path in the symbol tree **within a single file**. Thus, file or directory names should never
        be included in the `name_path`. For restricting the search to a single file or directory,
        the `within_relative_path` parameter should be used instead. The retrieved symbols' `name_path` attribute
        will always be composed of symbol names, never file or directory names.

        Key aspects of the name path matching behavior:
        - Trailing slashes in `name_path` play no role and are ignored.
        - The name of the retrieved symbols will match (either exactly or as a substring)
          the last segment of `name_path`, while other segments will restrict the search to symbols that
          have a desired sequence of ancestors.
        - If there is no starting or intermediate slash in `name_path`, there is no
          restriction on the ancestor symbols. For example, passing `method` will match
          against symbols with name paths like `method`, `class/method`, `class/nested_class/method`, etc.
        - If `name_path` contains a `/` but doesn't start with a `/`, the matching is restricted to symbols
          with the same ancestors as the last segment of `name_path`. For example, passing `class/method` will match against
          `class/method` as well as `nested_class/class/method` but not `method`.
        - If `name_path` starts with a `/`, it will be treated as an absolute name path pattern, meaning
          that the first segment of it must match the first segment of the symbol's name path.
          For example, passing `/class` will match only against top-level symbols like `class` but not against `nested_class/class`.
          Passing `/class/method` will match against `class/method` but not `nested_class/class/method` or `method`.

        :param depth: Depth to retrieve descendants (e.g., 1 for class methods/attributes).
        :param relative_path: Optional. Restrict search to this file or directory. If None, searches entire codebase.

            If a file is passed, the search will be restricted to that file.
            If you have some knowledge about the codebase, you should use this parameter, as it will significantly
            speed up the search as well as reduce the number of results.
